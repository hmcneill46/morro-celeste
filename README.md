# Morro — Celeste for Apple platforms

**Native Celeste for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, with full ahead-of-time compilation.**

Morro is named after Morro Rock in California. The searchable repository name is
**morro-celeste**. It carries the modern vanilla Apple port and the bounded static
Everest pipeline, retaining the original port's Git history, credits and license.
No JIT activation is required. The standalone source repository is
[hmcneill46/morro-celeste](https://github.com/hmcneill46/morro-celeste); the
original upstream remains credited and its history is preserved.

The companion [Cabrillo — Celeste Mod Loader for Apple Platforms](https://github.com/hmcneill46/cabrillo-celeste)
uses a separate Mono JIT runtime and mod-loader architecture. Cabrillo's iPadOS
and other Apple-platform plans belong to that project; they are not Morro support
claims. The repositories have independent builds and acceptance decisions.

## Start here

- [Current progress and evidence](docs/MORRO_STATUS.md) — The Squeeze closeout, current product evidence and remaining work.
- [Morro build and private-input guide](docs/MORRO_BUILDING.md) — independent local setup and unsigned vanilla/Everest commands.
- [Migration and file inventory](docs/MORRO_MIGRATION.md) — retained history, removed legacy files, attribution and publishing choices.
- [Credits](CREDITS.md) — original port, game, runtime, native and mod contributors.
- [Static Everest architecture](docs/APPLE_EVEREST_STATIC_AOT.md) and [compatibility scope](docs/APPLE_EVEREST_COMPATIBILITY.md).

Vanilla gameplay has its separate historical acceptance below. **The Squeeze
iPhone stage is closed within the owner's tested scope:** build 50 passed the
reported route, collectibles, save/cold-resume and Bing checks; build 51 fixes
the lobby card overlapping Pause, with the fix and saved silver confirmed on
device. See the [closeout and exact product identities](docs/testing/MORRO_SQUEEZE_CLOSEOUT.md).
Apple TV and static-Everest iPad acceptance remain deferred. The selection is
the Beginner lobby, Bing, The Squeeze and 18 regression maps; this is not general
Everest or whole-Beginner support. Each product retains its own observations.

The original build-49 products and migration evidence remain historical;
later results do not grant them physical acceptance. Exact IPA byte
reproducibility remains unresolved; see the [migration report](docs/history/morro-migration/MORRO_MIGRATION_REPORT.md).

An unofficial community project that builds native Apple versions of Celeste
from game files you already own. The mature Apple TV product and the modern
iPhone/iPad product share one locked Celeste/FNA pipeline, Metal graphics,
real FMOD audio, durable saves, and full-AOT compilation.

The Apple TV port is mature and playable. It has been extensively tested on an Apple TV
4K (3rd generation, 128 GB) and supports tvOS 16.0 or later. Other arm64 Apple
TV models may work, but have not received the same physical acceptance.

The iPhone/iPad port is also playable and has release-candidate acceptance on
an iPhone 15 Pro Max and an iPad mini 4 running iPadOS 15.8.8. It supports
touch-only play, controllers, customizable touch layouts, ordinary
Application Support saves, and native Files import/export.

This repository does **not** contain Celeste or the proprietary FMOD SDK. You
supply both from your own accounts; the builders validate them locally.

## Choose a platform

| I want to build for… | Start here | Main command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apple TV | [Apple TV local/cloud guide](docs/BUILDING.md) | `./build-tvos.sh` |
| iPhone or iPad | [iPhone/iPad self-build and install guide](docs/IOS_BUILDING.md) | `./build-ios.sh` |

Both products accept the same [nine exact Celeste 1.4.0.0 FNA
profiles](docs/CELESTE_INPUTS.md). The pinned device build path supports Intel x86_64 and Apple silicon arm64
macOS hosts. Unsigned compilation requires no connected device. The Apple TV
product additionally has the private unsigned cloud compilation route.

## Apple TV start here

You need:

1. An unmodified supported **Celeste 1.4.0.0 FNA** download from itch.io,
   Steam, or Epic Games Store.
2. **FMOD Engine iOS/tvOS 1.10.09 build 97915** from FMOD.
3. A way to compile:
   - a supported Intel or Apple silicon Mac for the local builder, or
   - your own private GitHub repository for cloud compilation.
4. A way to sign and install the app on your Apple TV. A cloud-built IPA is
   unsigned and cannot be installed until it is signed.

The guides below explain each part. You do not need to understand FNA, AOT, or
the native dependency pipeline to follow them.

## Choose how you want to build

    D --> F["Download the unsigned IPA"]
    F --> E
```

### Easiest if you do not have a Mac

Use the [private GitHub cloud builder](docs/CLOUD_BUILDING.md). GitHub supplies
the macOS build machine, so Windows and Linux users can compile a
**signing-ready unsigned IPA** without owning a Mac.

You create your own repository from the public template and make it private,
then upload one Celeste ZIP and the original FMOD DMG. The workflow refuses to
read inputs in a public repository, keeps the output private, and includes a
cleanup workflow for the input and output Releases. It never asks for Steam,
Epic, FMOD-account, or Apple-signing credentials.

Cloud compilation does **not** sign or install the app. You still need a
tvOS-capable signing and installation method afterward.

→ **[Build in the cloud](docs/CLOUD_BUILDING.md)**

### Build locally on a Mac

On a supported Intel or Apple silicon Mac, [`./build-tvos.sh`](build-tvos.sh) validates
the inputs, builds the native and managed code, and can either:

- sign and install directly using an Apple Account and a paired Apple TV;
- create an unsigned IPA; or
- do both.

The accepted setup uses full Xcode, .NET SDK 10.0.302 with tvOS workload set
10.0.302.0, GNU Make, and Mono. The host doctor reports missing tools without
requiring Celeste or FMOD:

```bash
./build-tvos.sh --check-host
```

CMake, Ninja, and ripgrep are **not** required. See the prerequisite checklist
and copyable clone commands in the [local build guide](docs/BUILDING.md).

## Step 1 — Get your Celeste files

The builder supports nine exact **Celeste 1.4.0.0 FNA** input profiles from
itch.io, Steam, and Epic Games Store across the tested Linux, macOS, and Windows
packages. It detects the actual contents automatically rather than trusting a
folder name.

The simplest choice depends on the store you own it on:

- **itch.io:** download one of the listed unmodified 1.4.0.0 FNA packages.
- **Steam:** the recommended route uses Steam's built-in console to download
  the tested Linux depot; it is only input for the builder and is not run on
  your Mac.
- **Epic Games Store:** obtain one tested Mac or Windows package from your own
  account; an optional Legendary-based route is documented.

Everest/modded, XNA, mixed, unknown, and other-version installations are not
currently supported. The validator rejects them instead of risking a broken
build.

Contributor note: an [experimental shared Apple static-Everest
foundation](docs/APPLE_EVEREST_STATIC_AOT.md) exists for tightly bounded,
pre-analysed full-AOT canaries, including a small
[exact real-mod test matrix](docs/APPLE_EVEREST_COMPATIBILITY.md). It is not
general mod support; ordinary users should continue to use the vanilla
iPhone/iPad and Apple TV builders above.

→ **[Choose and obtain supported Celeste files](docs/CELESTE_INPUTS.md)**

## Step 2 — Get FMOD

Download exactly **FMOD Engine iOS/tvOS 1.10.09 build 97915** from the
[official version-specific FMOD Engine page](https://www.fmod.com/download?version=1.10.09#fmodengine).

- Choose **FMOD Engine**, not FMOD Studio.
- Choose the **iOS** package; it contains the tvOS libraries this project uses.
- Use version **1.10.09** (also written **1.10.09, build 97915**), not FMOD 2.x
  or another release.
- FMOD may ask you to sign in before it shows the older download.

Download it through your own FMOD account and keep the DMG outside the
repository. The project validates it but does not redistribute it.

## Step 3 — Build

- **Supported Mac:** follow [Build locally](docs/BUILDING.md), then run
  `./build-tvos.sh`.
- **Windows, Linux, or no suitable Mac:** follow [Build in the
  cloud](docs/CLOUD_BUILDING.md) to create the unsigned IPA privately.

The local builder has eight numbered phases, privacy-safe progress heartbeats,
and full logs under ignored `dist/logs/`. If it stops, start with
`dist/logs/last-error.txt`.

## Step 4 — Sign and install

### Local direct install

With an Apple Account configured in Xcode, a paired developer-ready Apple TV,
and a stable bundle identifier, the local builder can provision, sign, install,
launch, and verify Celeste. A free Personal Team is sufficient, although its
development provisioning normally expires after about seven days and then
needs re-signing.

### Unsigned IPA

Local IPA mode and the cloud builder both produce
`Celeste-tvOS-unsigned.ipa`. Its conventional `Payload/Celeste.app` layout is
ready for a tvOS-capable signer, but it has no usable signature or provisioning
profile and cannot be installed directly. Signing tools and services are
outside this project's control; keep the same final bundle identifier if you
want replacement installs to retain the same save domain.

See [Building](docs/BUILDING.md#build-and-install-modes) for the accepted local
install flow and [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#unsigned-ipa-will-not-install-directly)
for unsigned-package help.

## What works?

### Gameplay

- Native arm64 tvOS gameplay with Metal rendering
- Real FMOD music, ambience, UI sounds, effects, and cutscene audio
- Extended-controller movement, Jump, Dash, Grab, menus, cutscene skip, and
  rumble; DualSense was physically tested
- Durable Settings and all three normal save slots
- Transparent compressed storage with recovery generations; Existing v1 installs require no manual migration

### Apple TV integration

- **Options → Controller Prompts** for Automatic, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo
  Switch, and Stadia on-screen button artwork; this changes artwork only, not
  mappings
- **Options → Performance HUD** for Apple's native Metal diagnostics
- A safe **Leave Celeste** flow instead of the old desktop-style blank screen
- Locally generated layered app icon and Top Shelf artwork

### Save management

- Explicitly activated same-network Save Manager
- One-time QR pairing, plus the manual address and six-digit-code fallback
- Download/backup, validated replacement, slot deletion, and Settings reset
- Confirm-driven verified soft reload without restarting the FNA runtime

### Building

- Local Mac build, signing, and direct install
- Private GitHub compilation for an unsigned IPA
- Exact multi-store input recognition and reproducible downstream generation

The technical acceptance matrix is in [Project status](docs/STATUS.md).

## Save Manager

Open **Options → Save Manager**, make sure your phone or computer is on the
same local network, and scan the QR code on the TV. The browser opens the
authenticated manager without typing the six-digit code. A numeric address and
code remain available as a fallback.

The server is dormant during normal gameplay and starts only while its menu is
open. It can back up or replace the four normal Celeste files (Settings and
slots 0–2). After a successful change, press Confirm on the Apple TV; Celeste
verifies the imported state and returns to a functional main menu. If that
verification fails, fully close the app from the Apple TV app switcher and
reopen it.

The displayed local address normally stays the same when Save Manager is
closed and reopened. An already open browser page notices when the manager is
closed or reopened and disables its controls until you reconnect. Every new
activation still uses fresh authentication, so reconnect with the new QR code
or access code rather than relying on an old page.

Save Manager is a temporary local-network tool, not cloud sync. Saves are
shared between Apple TV users in the same app installation, do not survive an
uninstall, and are not backed up to iCloud.

## Supported game versions

Only the nine listed unmodified Celeste 1.4.0.0 FNA profiles are supported.
They normalize to one locked downstream game, but that does not mean every
release from those storefronts is accepted. Review the [exact profile
matrix](docs/CELESTE_INPUTS.md) if validation rejects your files.

Everest/mod support and XNA inputs are not currently supported. The public
self-build workflow supports tvOS and modern iOS/iPadOS. The legacy iOS source
remains for provenance; use the [modern iPhone/iPad guide](docs/IOS_BUILDING.md)
for the current full-AOT product.

## Current limitations

- Personal-use self-build only; no App Store distribution is provided.
- The cloud result is unsigned and requires separate signing and installation.
- Free Personal Team installs generally need re-signing after about seven days.
- Apple User Management is unavailable with Personal Team provisioning, so
  saves are shared between Apple TV users.
- There is no iCloud/cloud-save sync or uninstall-survival guarantee.
- DualSense is the physically accepted controller; the Siri Remote is not an
  intended gameplay controller.

More precise tested-versus-compatible boundaries are in
[Project status](docs/STATUS.md).

## Troubleshooting

Start with the [beginner issue index](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#common-questions)
for game-file, FMOD, cloud, signing, save, and Save Manager problems. Build
failures name a complete log and write a privacy-safe summary to
`dist/logs/last-error.txt`.

Never post Celeste files, FMOD files, signed apps/IPAs, Apple credentials,
provisioning profiles, certificates, Team IDs, or device identifiers in an
issue.

## For developers

The beginner path is intentionally short; the engineering detail is still
available:

- [Documentation hub](docs/README.md)
- [Project status and architecture](docs/STATUS.md)
- [Advanced local build and reproducibility](docs/BUILDING.md)
- [Native dependency pipeline](native/README.md)
- [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Development and acceptance history](docs/history/README.md)

The original Xamarin.iOS project remains in Git history for provenance.
Morro's working tree contains the modern AOT project and its supporting records.
The beginner/public builders now cover Apple TV and iPhone/iPad independently.
Developers can also inspect the [modern iOS architecture](docs/IOS_FOUNDATION.md), which plays the
same canonical Celeste game on physical iPhone and iPad using either a
controller or adaptive touch controls, with customization including separate
Phone/Tablet layouts, edge-flush full-display placement, per-control opacity,
split-action and floating-movement regions, optional duplicated/niche controls
including Quick Restart, a dedicated
Journal/Special control, and source-aware Grab modes. Saves use durable
ordinary files and audio uses the real seven FMOD banks. **Options > Data &
Files** can export, share, validate, import, and restore ordinary `.celeste`
copies through native iOS Files UI, while custom `.celestetouch` layouts can
be shared from Touch Controls and previewed before import. Live saves stay
private in Application Support; this is explicit user-directed transfer, not
automatic cloud sync. The vanilla iOS/iPadOS product is a personal self-build
release candidate, not an App Store release.

## Project history and release candidates

- [v1.0.0-rc.2 release notes](docs/releases/v1.0.0-rc.2.md)
- [Current release-candidate manifest](tvos/release-candidates/v1.0.0-rc.2.json)
- [Chronological engineering history](docs/history/README.md)

Historical stage reports record how the port was proven. They are useful for
debugging and reproducibility, but are not required reading to build the app.
