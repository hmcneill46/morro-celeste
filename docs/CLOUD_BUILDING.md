# Build Celeste for iPhone, iPad or Apple TV in the cloud

The private GitHub cloud builder compiles vanilla Celeste for **iOS, tvOS, or
both** without requiring your own Mac. iOS produces one app for iPhone and iPad.
Supply files you own in your own **private** repository, choose the platform,
run the manual workflow, and download the verified unsigned IPA for each target.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your generated builder repository must be **Private** before you upload
> Celeste or FMOD. Never upload those files to the public template repository.

The cloud build stops at an unsigned, signing-ready IPA. Provisioning, signing,
and installation are separate and may still require a compatible external
signing path.

## Morro source selection

The [public template](https://github.com/hmcneill46/celeste-tvos-cloud-builder)
keeps its existing repository name. The current template pins both vanilla
builders to Morro commit `cc02b0cc697bd620c0dc864d4af3c60d79a95e85`, which retains
the locally verified migration product source. It does not build Everest or
load mods. A cloud build is new product evidence, not physical gameplay acceptance.

To export a private builder from a local Morro checkout instead:

```sh
python3 scripts/export-morro-cloud-builder.py \
  --destination ../Morro-Private-Builder \
  --source-repository hmcneill46/morro-celeste \
  --source-sha cc02b0cc697bd620c0dc864d4af3c60d79a95e85
```

The exporter creates six reviewed source files in a new directory and updates
both source-pin locations together. It does not create a repository, publish,
run Actions, or copy private inputs. Any replacement SHA must already be
published in the selected source repository and provide both vanilla builders.

## What you need

- A GitHub account.
- One ZIP containing an [exact supported Celeste 1.4.0.0 FNA
  input](CELESTE_INPUTS.md).
- The original official
  [**FMOD Engine iOS/tvOS 1.10.09 build 97915**](https://www.fmod.com/download?version=1.10.09#fmodengine)
  DMG. Choose FMOD Engine's iOS package, not FMOD Studio; FMOD may ask you to
  sign in before showing the older version.

You must own Celeste and obtain FMOD through your own account. The template
does not provide either input and never asks for Steam, Epic, FMOD, or Apple
credentials.

## Quick start

There are six steps: create a private repository, prepare the two inputs,
upload them to the fixed private input Release, run Build, download the unsigned
IPA, then run Cleanup. The headings below walk through them in order.

### 1. Create your private builder repository

Open the [public template](https://github.com/hmcneill46/celeste-tvos-cloud-builder),
choose **Use this template → Create a new repository**, and select **Private**.
Alternatively, push only the six-file local export above to an empty private
repository, including its hidden `.github` directory.

Never upload Celeste, FMOD or IPAs to either public source repository. The Build
workflow checks GitHub's API and requires both `private=true` and
`visibility=private` before checkout or private-input processing.

Existing private builders do not automatically receive template updates. Copy
all six current template files into your builder, preserving its private
visibility. The input/output Release tags and cleanup scope remain unchanged.

### 2. Prepare exactly two files

You need:

1. One `.zip` containing a supported Celeste installation.
2. The original FMOD iOS/tvOS 1.10.09 build 97915 `.dmg`.

If your supported Celeste download is already a ZIP, use it directly. If it is
an extracted folder or macOS app, compress that one folder/app to ZIP first:

- **Windows:** right-click the folder in File Explorer and choose **Compress to
  ZIP file** (or **Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder**).
- **macOS:** Control-click the folder or `.app` in Finder and choose
  **Compress**.
- **Linux:** use the file manager's **Compress** action and select ZIP; an
  optional terminal equivalent from the parent directory is
  `zip -r Celeste.zip Celeste-folder`.

Do not put an existing ZIP inside another ZIP. Upload the FMOD DMG unchanged;
Windows and Linux users do not need to open it. The [supported Celeste files
guide](CELESTE_INPUTS.md) covers itch.io, Steam, and Epic inputs.

### 3. Upload the inputs privately

In the private builder repository:

1. Open **Releases** and choose **Draft a new release**.
2. For **Choose a tag**, enter `celeste-tvos-inputs` and create that tag.
3. Use `celeste-tvos-inputs` as the release title.
4. Add exactly the Celeste ZIP and FMOD DMG.
5. Wait for both uploads to finish, then click **Publish release**.

Filenames do not matter. The workflow records each asset's size and SHA-256,
checks GitHub's digest when available, safely extracts the ZIP, then uses the
project's exact Celeste and FMOD validators. It rejects unknown, modified, or
wrong-version inputs.

### 4. Run the build

1. Open the repository's **Actions** tab.
2. Select **Build Celeste for Apple platforms**.
3. Click **Run workflow**, choose `tvos`, `ios`, or `both`, then confirm the run.

Each platform has an optional bundle identifier with a default; most users
should leave both unchanged. `tvos` remains the default target. `both` downloads
the two inputs once, builds tvOS then iOS sequentially, and publishes only after
both products pass verification. The workflow runs only when manually started,
serializes build/cleanup operations, and has a three-hour timeout.

The existing platform builders report timed phases. Long native or full-AOT operations
print a heartbeat every 60 seconds with elapsed time and free disk space.
GitHub groups each phase; seeing another heartbeat means the process is still
alive. Historical tvOS acceptance measured roughly 30–35 minutes without cache and
about 15 minutes with the verified safe cache. Those timings do not predict
iOS or `both`; runner load and images can also change them. The iOS native
build currently runs without a cross-run cache.

### 5. Download the unsigned IPA

After success, the workflow summary links to the private
`celeste-tvos-output` Release. Download:

| Selection | Download | Build record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tvos` | `Celeste-tvOS-unsigned.ipa` | `Celeste-tvOS-build.txt` |
| `ios` | `Celeste-iOS-unsigned.ipa` | `Celeste-iOS-build.txt` |
| `both` | Both IPAs above | Both build records |

Each build record gives the exact public source commit, detected game profile,
IPA size and SHA-256. Products are Release `tvos-arm64` or `ios-arm64`, fully
trimmed, full AOT, with `UseInterpreter=false`. The iOS IPA supports both
arm64 iPhone and iPad devices; it is not a Simulator app.

The IPAs are **unsigned and cannot be installed as-is**. Continue with
[Apple TV signing](../README.md#step-4--sign-and-install) or
[iPhone/iPad signing and installation](IOS_BUILDING.md#cloud-build-without-a-mac).

The tags still use `celeste-tvos-` for compatibility with existing builders;
the output Release can now contain either or both platforms. A draft is
published only after all expected uploaded assets pass size/digest checks.

### 6. Remove the private build files

Once the IPA is safely downloaded:

1. Return to **Actions**.
2. Select **Clean private build files**.
3. Click **Run workflow**.
4. Leave safe-cache deletion off for faster repeat builds, or enable it to
   remove that small open-source cache too.

The cleanup deletes only the `celeste-tvos-inputs` and
`celeste-tvos-output` Releases/tags. It can be run twice safely. The project
does not use normal GitHub Actions artifacts for the inputs or IPA.

## Privacy and ownership

The cloud route temporarily uploads your Celeste ZIP and FMOD DMG as private
Release assets in your private GitHub repository. A GitHub-hosted runner
downloads and processes them. Private does **not** mean those files stay on
your own computer. If you do not want to upload them to GitHub, use the
[local Mac builder](BUILDING.md).

The runner removes transferred, extracted, generated, app, and IPA work files
before the job ends. The separate cleanup workflow removes the two private
Releases from GitHub. Only two redistributable/open-source native output paths
may enter the optional cache; Celeste, FMOD, generated game source, app bundles,
and IPAs are excluded.

The built IPA contains user-supplied Celeste content and should remain private
and personal. This project supplies no game/FMOD files and grants no
redistribution rights.

## Cost and limits

Private-repository workflows use the repository owner's GitHub Actions
allowance and billing settings. Check GitHub's current [Actions billing
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions)
before running a build; the project cannot know an account's remaining quota.

The workflow requires at least 25 GiB free on the runner before expensive work.
Each input asset and the output IPA must be below GitHub Releases' current
2 GiB per-file limit. It never splits inputs or products automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### My repository is public

Create a new **Private** repository from the template. The Build workflow
deliberately fails before checkout or input download in a public repository.

### The input Release is missing or has the wrong files

Publish a Release/tag named exactly `celeste-tvos-inputs` with exactly one
`.zip` and one `.dmg`. Remove drafts and extra assets.

### Celeste or FMOD is rejected

Use one exact profile from the [supported-input matrix](CELESTE_INPUTS.md) and
the original FMOD Engine iOS/tvOS 1.10.09 build 97915 DMG. Renaming or mixing
another version will not satisfy validation.

### The output Release already exists

Download it if needed, run **Clean private build files**, and upload the two
inputs again before starting Build. Cleanup removes inputs as well as outputs.
The workflow preserves existing published outputs and incomplete output drafts
instead of overwriting them. A failed upload can leave a draft requiring cleanup.

### The runner reports too little disk

Retry later or use the local Mac builder. The workflow does not remove system
Xcodes or weaken the 25 GiB safety threshold.

### GitHub says Actions minutes or billing are unavailable

Review the account/repository's Actions allowance and billing settings. The
workflow cannot bypass GitHub account limits and never starts automatically.

### The build appears slow or fails in native/full AOT

Expand the current GitHub log group. A heartbeat every 60 seconds during a
long operation is expected. On failure, the summary names the failed phase,
shows a bounded redacted diagnostic tail where available, and keeps the input
Release for a corrected retry.

### The IPA will not install

That is expected until it is signed. The workflow intentionally has no Apple
credentials, certificate, or provisioning profile. Follow the separate
[signing guidance](../README.md#step-4--sign-and-install).

## Security and reproducibility design

<details>
<summary>Technical details</summary>

- The public template contains only workflow/helper source. Users create a
  separate private repository from it.
- Build uses manual `workflow_dispatch`, least-privilege `contents: write`, one
  repository concurrency group, and a 180-minute timeout.
- Official `actions/checkout` and `actions/cache` revisions are pinned to full
  immutable commit SHAs.
- The workflow builds exact public source commit
  `cc02b0cc697bd620c0dc864d4af3c60d79a95e85`, verifies that checkout and its
  recursive submodules, and never follows a floating branch.
- The runner is the standard ARM64 `macos-26` image and must match Xcode 26.6,
  iOS/tvOS SDK 26.5, .NET SDK 10.0.302, and workload set 10.0.302.0. Xcode
  is selected through process-local `DEVELOPER_DIR`; the system selection is
  unchanged. An ephemeral `global.json` selects the exact SDK before workload
  setup, even when the runner also includes newer SDKs. The iOS host doctor
  requires both iOS and tvOS workloads, including for an iOS-only request.
- ZIP paths, duplicate/case-colliding entries, links, special files, expanded
  size, and extraction containment are checked before the existing exact
  validators run.
- The only cached paths are `artifacts/tvos-native/self-build` and
  `.build/tvos-host`. Their native logical hash is independently verified after
  restoration. They are used only for `tvos` and `both`; iOS has no cloud cache.
- The output is a private Release, not an Actions artifact. Runner cleanup is
  unconditional, while remote Releases are removed only by the user's explicit
  cleanup workflow.
- Maintainers update the pinned source only after testing a new accepted
  commit, running the template verifier, performing a representative private
  cloud build, and deliberately publishing the synchronized template.
